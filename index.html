It’s due to come out in Autumn 2023 with Verso Books.\n\nI also write about films — usually with a focus on masculinity or class. You can find my articles at Tribune, Licence to Queer and The Film Magazine. I also keep a film review blog called [Alone in the Front Row](https://www.facebook.com/aloneinthefrontrow/).\n\nI’ve written about politics for Novara Media, The Independent, VICE, Erotic Review, Jacobin, Open Democracy, ROAR Magazine and the Verso Blog.\n\nTopics have included the politics of northern England, nuclear energy, internet censorship, the moral panic over ‘fake news’, UK floods policy and the political efficacy of ‘egging’. I’ve also helped my dad write about the joy of making cocktails at home for Cocktail Lovers magazine.\n\nFuture projects include books on communist business ethics, masculinity, James Bond, and the nuclear energy debate.","teaser":"My first book, an analysis of algorithmic power in workplaces, is forthcoming with Verso. I also write about film, politics and more across the internet."},{"title":"Novara Media","content":"Novara Media is an independent multimedia outlet specialising in political commentary and analysis. I joined Novara late in 2013 and launched its articles section – then called ‘NovaraWire’ – in February 2014. I initially ran the section solo and then became Head of Articles as the articles team expanded.\n\nNowadays I am Novara’s Head of Operations. This means supporting the team on a day-to-day basis, problem-solving, and ensuring the organisation grows sustainably and effectively. I see it as an enterprise in developing communist business ethics for the postdigital era.\n\nI also contribute to Novara’s articles, audio and video content from time to time.\n\nNovara Media is published by Thousand Hands Ltd, a not-for-profit company of which I am a Director. It is regulated by IMPRESS, the statutory press regulator, where I am a member of the Code Committee.\n\nClick [here] to email me at my Novara account.","teaser":"I’m Head of Operations at Novara Media, an independent media outlet that aims to address the defining challenges of the 21st century. I was formerly a senior editor."},{"title":"Research and teaching","content":"My research interests are motivated by two primary concerns – work and digital media – and the space between them. My interests expand to all areas of work/labour and all areas of digital media, including journalism and digital culture.\n\nI’ve taught about these topics and more to postgraduate and undergraduate students, having led seminars and/or written/delivered lectures on digital labour, net infrastructure and protocol, social control, citizen journalism, ‘fake news’, platform capitalism, algorithmic power and more. I am available for guest lectures.\n\nI have a PhD from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick. Titled ‘The Politics of Algorithmic Management: Class Composition and Everyday Struggle in Distribution Work’, the research drew on autonomist Marxism to conduct a class composition analysis of digitally-mediated labour relations in contemporary logistics work. It was supervised by Nate Tkacz and Celia Lury, and examined by Phoebe V. Moore and Michael Dieter.\n\nMy work on algorithmic management was recently cited in a report on the consequences of algorithmic management delivered to the European Commission’s joint research centre.\n\nIn 2018/19 I was an Early Career Fellow at the University of Warwick’s Institute for Advanced Study. I’ve also worked as a research assistant on an EU Parliament project, published a small handful of journal articles, co-authored a book chapter and presented my research at dozens of academic conferences and events across the world. I am currently on the editorial advisory board for the journal Consumption, Markets \u0026 Culture.\n\nBefore that, I did an MA in Social and Political Thought at Sussex University and a joint honours degree in Philosophy and Politics \u0026 International Relations at Royal Holloway, University of London, having previously started a degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. I also picked up a Postgraduate Certificate in Social Sciences Research at some point along the way.\n\nPrior to university I worked as an optical consultant for a high-street opticians chain. It’s fair to say my route into higher education was contingent rather than predetermined, but luckily for me I eventually settled in as the student movement of 2010 was unfolding. Those events shaped pretty much everything that followed.\n\nIf you’d like to read any of my research, have a nosey at my CV or just share ideas, it’s probably best to email me at my [Novara address].","teaser":"I have an academic background in the research of the digitalisation of labour relations, algorithmic management, and resistance to computational media."}],"header":"Hi, I’m **Craig Gent**.
