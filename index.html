Work is one of the primary ways we interact with informational capitalism, and I aim to ensure labour’s place within analyses of digital society.\n\nI have contributed to ethical guidelines for the use of AI in newsrooms at Impress, and I am a research affiliate at the Autonomy Institute. I regularly speak to audiences of people who care about the stakes of AI, algorithmic management, and the digital mediation of work and society. I have written on these topics for Logic magazine, the Ada Lovelace Institute, the Verso blog, and my work on Amazon has been translated into eight languages.\n\nI am an alumnus of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick (PhD, 2019), the Centre for Social and Political Thought at the University of Sussex (MA, 2014), and Royal Holloway, University of London (BA (Hons), 2013).","teaser":"I’m a scholar of digital media and culture, and the author of *Cyberboss: The Rise of Algorithmic Management and the New Struggle for Control at Work* (Verso Books)."},{"title":"Media, culture and politics","content":"I have over ten years’ experience as a media practitioner. For over ten years, I have been a senior editor and journalist at [Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com), where I am a director.\n\nIn my current role as North of England Editor, I write about shifts in the organisation of life and work for working-class people between the Trent and the border, and consider what it means for the political forms needed to bring about changes in British society.\n\nI am also the co-host (with Sarah Jaffe) of [Heart Reacts](https://shows.acast.com/heart-reacts), a podcast for people who are trying to live their lives in accordance with their politics. We call it a ‘wager on shared experience’.\n\nMore broadly, I have a range of experience in podcasting, broadcasting and writing (specialising in features). I occasionally consult for mission-led organisations that are in the process of growing their operations.\n\nI have also written about topics such as activism, masculinity, visual cultures and the media for outlets including the Independent, VICE, Jacobin, Erotic Review, Licence to Queer, Open Democracy, ROAR Magazine, Empire Online and the Film Magazine.","teaser":"I have over ten years’ experience as a media practitioner.
