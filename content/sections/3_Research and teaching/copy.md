My research interests are motivated by two primary concerns – work and digital media – and the space between them. My interests expand to all areas of work/labour and all areas of digital media, including journalism and digital culture.

I’ve taught about these topics and more to postgraduate and undergraduate students, having led seminars and/or written/delivered lectures on digital labour, net infrastructure and protocol, social control, citizen journalism, ‘fake news’, platform capitalism, algorithmic power and more. I am available for guest lectures.

I have a PhD from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick. Titled ‘The Politics of Algorithmic Management: Class Composition and Everyday Struggle in Distribution Work’, the research drew on autonomist Marxism to conduct a class composition analysis of digitally-mediated labour relations in contemporary logistics work. It was supervised by Nate Tkacz and Celia Lury, and examined by Phoebe V. Moore and Michael Dieter.

My work on algorithmic management was recently cited in a report on the consequences of algorithmic management delivered to the European Commission’s joint research centre.

In 2018/19 I was an Early Career Fellow at the University of Warwick’s Institute for Advanced Study. I’ve also worked as a research assistant on an EU Parliament project, published a small handful of journal articles, co-authored a book chapter and presented my research at dozens of academic conferences and events across the world. I am currently on the editorial advisory board for the journal Consumption, Markets & Culture.

Before that, I did an MA in Social and Political Thought at Sussex University and a joint honours degree in Philosophy and Politics & International Relations at Royal Holloway, University of London, having previously started a degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. I also picked up a Postgraduate Certificate in Social Sciences Research at some point along the way.

Prior to university I worked as an optical consultant for a high-street opticians chain. It’s fair to say my route into higher education was contingent rather than predetermined, but luckily for me I eventually settled in as the student movement of 2010 was unfolding. Those events shaped pretty much everything that followed.
