I'm interested in the creative use of media to facilite change, community, intersubjectivity and solidarity. I have fifteen years’ experience as a media practitioner, including as a senior editor and director at [Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com), and I'm a participant in the [StreamArtNetwork](https://networkcultures.org/void/2024/11/14/launch-of-the-stream-art-network-san/).
