I have over ten years’ experience as a media practitioner. For over ten years, I have been a senior editor and journalist at [Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com), where I am a director.

In my current role as North of England Editor, I write about shifts in the organisation of life and work for working-class people between the Trent and the border, and consider what it means for the political forms needed to bring about changes in British society.

I am also the co-host (with Sarah Jaffe) of [Heart Reacts](https://shows.acast.com/heart-reacts), a podcast for people who are trying to live their lives in accordance with their politics. We call it a ‘wager on shared experience’.

More broadly, I have a range of experience in podcasting, broadcasting and writing (specialising in features). I occasionally consult for mission-led organisations that are in the process of growing their operations.

I have also written about topics such as activism, masculinity, visual cultures and the media for outlets including the Independent, VICE, Jacobin, Erotic Review, Licence to Queer, Open Democracy, ROAR Magazine, Empire Online and the Film Magazine.
