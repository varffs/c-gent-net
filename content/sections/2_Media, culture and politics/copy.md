I have over ten years’ experience as a media practitioner. For eleven years, I was a senior editor and journalist at [Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com), where I was a director.

Some of my key achievements at Novara Media include expanding the team, overseeing the transition from being a voluntary enterprise to a full-time professional company as the organisation's first Head of Operations, and later becoming Novara's first North of England Editor. In addition to being a member of the Code Committee of the press regulator Impress, I am a co-opted committee member at the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust.

I am also the co-host (with Sarah Jaffe) of [Heart Reacts](https://shows.acast.com/heart-reacts), a podcast for people who are trying to live their lives in accordance with their politics. We call it a ‘wager on shared experience’.

More broadly, I have a range of experience in podcasting, broadcasting and writing (specialising in features). I occasionally consult for mission-led organisations that are in the process of growing their operations.

I have also written about topics such as activism, masculinity, visual cultures and the media for outlets including the Independent, VICE, Jacobin, Erotic Review, Licence to Queer, Open Democracy, ROAR Magazine, Empire Online and the Film Magazine.
