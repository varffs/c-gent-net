Novara Media is an independent multimedia outlet specialising in political commentary and analysis. I joined Novara late in 2013 and launched its articles section – then called ‘NovaraWire’ – in February 2014. I initially ran the section solo and then became Head of Articles as the articles team expanded.

Nowadays I am Novara’s Head of Operations. This means supporting the team on a day-to-day basis, problem-solving, and ensuring the organisation grows sustainably and effectively. I see it as an enterprise in developing communist business ethics for the postdigital era.

I also contribute to Novara’s articles, audio and video content from time to time.

Novara Media is published by Thousand Hands Ltd, a not-for-profit company of which I am a Director. It is regulated by IMPRESS, the statutory press regulator, where I am a member of the Code Committee.
