I am writing a book about cyber-bosses and the people who work for them in the logistics sector and beyond. It’s due to come out in Autumn 2023 with Verso Books.

I also write about films — usually with a focus on masculinity or class. You can find my articles at Tribune, Licence to Queer and The Film Magazine. I also keep a film review blog called [Alone in the Front Row](https://www.facebook.com/aloneinthefrontrow/).

I’ve written about politics for Novara Media, The Independent, VICE, Erotic Review, Jacobin, Open Democracy, ROAR Magazine and the Verso Blog.

Topics have included the politics of northern England, nuclear energy, internet censorship, the moral panic over ‘fake news’, UK floods policy and the political efficacy of ‘egging’. I’ve also helped my dad write about the joy of making cocktails at home for Cocktail Lovers magazine.

Future projects include books on communist business ethics, masculinity, James Bond, and the nuclear energy debate.
