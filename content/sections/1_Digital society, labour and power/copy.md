I’m a scholar of digital media and culture, and the author of [*Cyberboss: The Rise of Algorithmic Management and the New Struggle for Control at Work*](https://shop.novaramedia.com/products/cyberboss) (Verso Books).

I specialise in researching and writing about the social, political and ethical consequences of the application of digital technology to work, from algorithms and AI to screens to scan-guns. Work is one of the primary ways we interact with informational capitalism, and I aim to ensure labour’s place within analyses of digital society.

I have contributed to ethical guidelines for the use of AI in newsrooms at Impress, and I am a research affiliate at the Autonomy Institute. I regularly speak to audiences of people who care about the stakes of AI, algorithmic management, and the digital mediation of work and society. I have written on these topics for Logic(s) magazine, the Ada Lovelace Institute, the Verso blog, and my work on Amazon has been translated into eight languages.

I am an alumnus of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick (PhD, 2019), the Centre for Social and Political Thought at the University of Sussex (MA, 2014), and Royal Holloway, University of London (BA (Hons), 2013).
