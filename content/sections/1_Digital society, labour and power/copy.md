I’m a scholar of algorithmic media and culture at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the writer behind [*Cyberboss: The Rise of Algorithmic Management and the New Struggle for Control at Work*](https://shop.novaramedia.com/products/cyberboss) (Verso Books), which is coming soon in Korean and Spanish.

I write about digital technology and informational capitalism. One way I do this is through attention to 'work' as a social activity where the political and ethical stakes of screens, scan guns, algorithms, AI, etc can be worked out. Of course, I'm really interested in power, agency and justice.

I have contributed to ethical guidelines for the use of AI in newsrooms at Impress, and I am a research affiliate at the Autonomy Institute. I regularly speak to audiences of people who care about the effects of AI, algorithmic management, and the algorithmic mediation of work and society. I have written on these topics for Logic(s) magazine, the Ada Lovelace Institute, the Verso blog, and my work on Amazon has been translated into eight languages.

I am an alumnus of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick (PhD, 2019), the Centre for Social and Political Thought at the University of Sussex (MA, 2014), and Royal Holloway, University of London (BA (Hons), 2013).
